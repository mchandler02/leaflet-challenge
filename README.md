# Leaflet-Challenge
Created a Leaflet map of earthquakes over the past 7 days that have been M4.5+. The size of the markers correlate to the magnitude and the color of the markers correlate to the depth of the earthquake.

Used html, javascript (using Leaflet library), and CSS to create the map.

Map was pulled from Mapbox. Earthquake data was pulled from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).
